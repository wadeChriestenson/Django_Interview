        <h2>About Django</h2>
        <p>Django (named after the Django Reinhardt) is a high-level Python-based free and open-source web framework
            that follows the model-view-template(MVT) architectural pattern. As of now, the framework is maintained
            by Django Software Foundation (DSF), an independent organization based in the US and established as a 501(c)(3) non-benefit.</p>
        <p>It was created in the fall of 2003 when the web programmers at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper,
            Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willson. Begin using Python to build applications. Two years later, in July 2005,
            it was released to the public under a BSD license. Later, in June 2008, the fledgling
            Django Software Foundation(DSF) took over the development of Django.</p>

                    <div class="ol">
                        <p class="l">1. Explain Django Architecture?</p>
                        <a class="lA">Django follows the MVT (<b><i>Model View Template</i></b>) pattern which is based on the
                        Model View Controller architecture. It's slightly different from the MVC pattern as it maintains its own conventions,
                            so, the controller is handled by the framework itself. The template is a presentation layer.
                            It is an HTML file mixed with <b><i>Django Template Language (DTL)</i></b>. The developer provides the model,
                            the view, and the template then maps it to a URL, and finally, Django serves it to the user.
                        </a>
                        <p class="l">2. Explain the Django project directory structure?</p>
                        <a class="lA">
                            <ul>
                                <li><b><i>manage.py</i></b> - A command-line utility that allows you to interact with your Django project.</li>
                                <li><b><i>__inti__.py</i></b> - An empty file that tells Python that the current directory should be considered as a Python package.</li>
                                <li><b><i>settings.py</i></b> - Comprises the configurations of the current project like DB connections.</li>
                                <li><b><i>urls.py</i></b> - All the URLsof the project are present here.</li>
                                <li><b><i>wsgi.py</i></b> - This is an entry point for your application which is used by the web servers to server the project you have created.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </a>
                        <p class="l">3.What are models in Django?</p>
                        <a class="lA">A <b><i>model</i></b> in Django refers to a class that maps to a database table or database collection.
                        Each attribute of the Django model class represents a database field. They are defined in app/model.py.
                            Every Model inherits from <b><i>django.db.models.Model</i></b>. The metaclass helps you sets things like
                            available permissions, singular and plural versions of the name, associated database table name,
                            whether the model is abstract or not, etc.</a>
                        <p class="l">4. What are templates in Django or Django template language?</p>
                        <a class="lA"><b><i>Templates</i></b> are an integral part of Django MVT architecture. They generally comprise
                        HTML, CSS, and JS in which dynamic variables and information are embedded with the help of views.
                            Some constructs are recognized and interpreted by the template engine. The main ones are variables and tags.
                        A template is rendered with a contex. Rendering just replaces variables with their values, present in context,
                        and processes tags. Everything else remains as it is.
                            <p>The syntax of the Django template language includes the following for constructs:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b><i>Variables</i></b></li>
                            <li><b><i>Tags</i></b></li>
                            <li><b><i>Filters</i></b></li>
                            <li><b><i>Comments</i></b></li>
                        </ul>
                        </a>
                        <p class="l">5. What are views in Django?</p>
                        <a class="lA">A view function, or "<b><i>view</i></b>" for short, is simply a Python function that takes a web request and returns a web responses.
                            This response can be HTML contents of a web page, or a redirect, or a 404 error, or an XML document, or an image, etc.
                        <p>
                            There are two types of views:
                        </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b><i>Function-Based Views:</i></b> In this, we import our views as a function.</li>
                                <li><b><i>Class-Based Views:</i></b> It's an object-oriented approach.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </a>
                        <p class="l">6. What is Django ORM?</p>
                        <a class="lA">This <b><i>ORM</i></b> (an acronym for <b><i>Object Relational Mapper</i></b>) enables us to interact with databases in more pythonic
                        way like we can avoid writings raw queries, it is possible to retrieve, save, delete and perform other
                        operations over the database without ever writing any SQL query. It works as an abstraction layer between the models and the database.</a>
                        <p class="l">7. Define static files and explain their uses?</p>
                        <a class="lA">Websites, generally need to serve additional files such as images, Javascript or CSS.
                        In Django, these files are referred to as "static file", Apart from that Django provides
                            <b><i>django.contrib.staticfiles</i></b> to manage these files.</a>
                        <p class="l">8. What is Django Rest Framework(DRF)?</p>
                        <a class="lA">Django Rest Framework is an open-source framework based upon Django which lets
                        you create RESTful APIs rapidly.</a>
                        <p class="l">9. What is django-admin and manage.py and explain its commands?</p>
                        <a class="lA">django-admin is Django's command-line utility for administrative task.
                        In addition to this, a manage.py file is also automatically created in each Django project.
                            Not only does it perform the same purpose as the django-admin, but it also sets the <b><i>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</i></b>
                         environment variables to point to the project's settings.py file
                        <ul>

                        <a class="lA">URLs are one of the most important parts of a web application and Django provides you with an
                            elegant way to design your own custom URLs with the help of its module known as <b><i>URLconf</i></b>
                        (URL Configuration). The basic functionality of this Python module is you can design your own URLs in Django
                        in the way you like and then map them to the Python function (View function). These URLs can be
                        static as well as dynamic. These URLs as present in the <b><i>urls.py</i></b> where they are matched with the equivalent view function.<br><br>
                        <b><i>
                            from django.urls import path<br>

                        <p class="l">12. What is the difference between a project and an app in Django?</p>
                        <a class="lA">In simple words a <b><i>Project</i></b> is the entire Django application and an <b><i>App</i></b> is a
                            module inside the project that deals with one specific use case.<br>
                            For eg, payment systems(app) in the eCommerce app(Project)</a>
                        <p class="l">13. What are the different model inheritance styles in Django?</p>
                        <a class="lA"><ul>
                            <li><b><i>Abstract Base Class Inheritance:</i></b> Used when you only need the parent class to
                            hold information that you don't want to write for each child model.</li>
                            <li><b><i>Multi-Table Model Inheritance:</i></b> Used when you are subclassing an existing model and need each model to have its own table in the database.</li>
                            <li><b><i>Proxy Model Inheritance:</i></b> Used when you want to retain the model's field while altering the Python level functioning of the model.</li>
                        </ul></a>
