        <h2>About Django</h2>
        <p>Django (named after the Django Reinhardt) is a high-level Python-based free and open-source web framework
            that follows the model-view-template(MVT) architectural pattern. As of now, the framework is maintained
            by Django Software Foundation (DSF), an independent organization based in the US and established as a 501(c)(3) non-benefit.</p>
        <p>It was created in the fall of 2003 when the web programmers at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper,
            Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willson. Begin using Python to build applications. Two years later, in July 2005,
            it was released to the public under a BSD license. Later, in June 2008, the fledgling
            Django Software Foundation(DSF) took over the development of Django.</p>

                        <p class="l">1. Explain Django Architecture?</p>
                        <a class="lA">Django follows the MVT (Model View Template) pattern which is based on the
                        Model View Controller architecture. It's slightly different from the MVC pattern as it maintains its own conventions,
                            so, the controller is handled by the framework itself. The template is a presentation layer.
                            It is an HTML file mixed with Django Template Language (DTL). The developer provides the model,
                            the view, and the template then maps it to a URL, and finally, Django serves it to the user.
