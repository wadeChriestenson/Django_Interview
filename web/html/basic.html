                        <a class="l1A">Django follows the MVT (Model View Template) pattern which is based on the
                        Model View Controller architecture. It's slightly different from the MVC pattern as it maintains its own conventions,
                            so, the controller is handled by the framework itself. The template is a presentation layer.
                            It is an HTML file mixed with Django Template Language (DTL). The developer provides the model,
                            the view, and the template then maps it to a URL, and finally, Django serves it to the user.</a>
