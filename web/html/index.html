        <h2>About Django</h2>
        <p>Django (named after the Django Reinhardt) is a high-level Python-based free and open-source web framework
            that follows the model-view-template(MVT) architectural pattern. As of now, the framework is maintained
            by Django Software Foundation (DSF), an independent organization based in the US and established as a 501(c)(3) non-benefit.</p>
        <p>It was created in the fall of 2003 when the web programmers at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper,
            Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willson. Begin using Python to build applications. Two years later, in July 2005,
            it was released to the public under a BSD license. Later, in June 2008, the fledgling
            Django Software Foundation(DSF) took over the development of Django.</p>

                <h3 class="subTitle">Reasons to use Django.</h3>
                    <div class="ol">
                        <h5>Itâ€™s Superfast:</h5>
                        <p>Django takes care of all the files and settings.
                            This allows us to build applications swiftly, right from development to production.</p>
                        <h5>Highly Secure:</h5>
                        <p>We tend to constantly worry about the security of our website. Questions like,
                        is the website safe or is it hackable, seem to penetrate our minds. However,
                        in Django, when it comes to security, just sit back and relax.
                            SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, and clickjacking are all taken care of.</p>
                        <h5>Easily Scalable:</h5>
                        <p>Django can handle huge traffic with zero latency.
                            We can use any cloud platform like GCP, AWS, or Heroku to deploy our Django application.
                            One other advantage is we can integrate machine learning algorithms using Python libraries and still be able to handle it.</p>
                        <h5>Easy Templating:</h5>
                        <p>Django is a back-end web framework. To interact with the front end, Django uses Jinja,
                            a simple templating engine that allows us to pass variables from back end to front end.
                            The syntax is quite easy; however, we can also configure our Django project with other templating engines.</p>
